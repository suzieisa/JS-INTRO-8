PATH = location = where you are

Home directory: 
Windows -> C:/Users/{username}
Mac -> /Users/{username}

Root directory:
Windows -> C:/
Mac -> /

How to navigate to Home directory?
Mac -> Go to Finder and use cmd + shift + H
Windows -> Go to File Explorer, navigate C drive, click on Users and click on your username

2. ls (mac) or dir (windows)
ls -> list
dir -> directories
