Array Methods

Products
-Array is a widely used data structure in any programming language .
-Data Structure: general term used for componenets for storing data.

You need to know a few things about each method of the array, string, object or whenever you leanr a new method
-methodName
-task that it runs
-does it take argument? if yes, how many or what type of arguments
-does it return an anything? if yes, than what

1. push() method
- add new elements to an existing array - to the tail
- yes it may take one or multiple elements as arguments
- yes the new length of the array as a number 
- it changes the original array

2. pop() method
- removes the last element from exisiting array from the end -tail
- it does not take an argument
- it returns the removed element back 
-it changes the original array 

shift vs unshift
unshift -- adds and makes array longer
shift -- remove and makes array shorter

3. unshift() method 
- add new elements to an existing array - to the head
- yes it may take one or multiple elements as arguments
- yes the new length of the array as a number 
- it changes the original array

4. shift() method 
- removes the first element from exisiting array from the beginning - head
- it does not take an argument
- it returns the removed element back 
- it changes the original array 

5. includes() method
- checks if the element exists in an array and returns a boolean
- it only takes one element as an argument to check if it exists or not
- returns true or false
- it does not change the original array

6. indexOf() method
- checks if an element exists in the array and returns the first found occurence index
- it takes one element as an argument
- it returns an index as a number ( 0 or positive if th enumber exists)
- if it doesnt exist always returns -1
- it does not change anything in an array

7. lastIndexOf () method 
- checks if an element exists in the array and returns the last found occurence index
- it takes one element as an argument
- it returns an index as a number
- if it doesnt exist always returns -1
- it does not change anything in an array

8. concat() method 
- concatenates an two or more arrays together
- it takes an array as an argument 
- it returns a new array the combination of two or more 
- it doesnt change the original array

Spread operator: used to expand an array into its individaul elements
NOTE: this could be useful when cocatenting and pushing multiple elements

9. reverse() method
- reverses the original array
- it does not take any argument
- it returns the modified result
- it changes the original array 

10. slice() method 
- used to get a sub array from original array
- it takes an argument as starting or ending indexes
- it returns sub array
- it does not change the original array


11. splice() method
- adds / removes or do both with an array
- it takes 2 or more arguments
- first argument that defines the position where elements should be added/ removed
- second argumnet defines how many elements should be removed
- rest of the arguments define the new elements to be added
- it returns the removed elemtns in an array 
- yes it changes the original array
