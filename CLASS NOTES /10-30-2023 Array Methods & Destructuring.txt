- typeof operator for arrays returns object 

How do you understand if a variable is an array? INTERVIEW QUESTION
- You can use Array.isArray() method to check if a varabiable is actually an array
- If this method returns true then the variable is an array, otherwise it will return false stating the variable is not an array

12. Array.isArray() method
- used to check if a variable is an array.
- it takes an argument to be checked
- it returns a boolean. It returns true or false depending if variable is actually an array or false otherwise
- does not change original array

13. sort() method
- task is used to sort array elements
    Strings: sorts alphabetically
    Numbers: You may expect to sort from smaller to greater number but still alphabetically
- it does not take any argument when you are sorting Strings, BUT we can have some argument to sort Numbers
- it returns the original array back sorted
- it modifies the original array

SORTING NUMBERS with a comparison callback function

callback function: is a function passed into another function as an argument

const numbers = [1, 2, 5, 100, 21];
numbers.sort((x,y) => x - y); // sorting ascending smaller - to bigger
numbers.sort((x,y) => y- x); // sorting descending larger - smaller

console.log(numbers); // [ 1, 2, 5, 21, 100 ]

a               b                  a-b              information
1               2                   -1              1 should be before 2
2               5                   -3              2 should be before 5
5               100                 -95             5 shoud be before 100
100             21                  79              100 should be after 21 


14. flat() method
- reduces the dimension of nested arrays with their elements
- if it is only one nested array, you dont need to but for more than one nested array
you may use dimension
- it returns a new array which flattened
- does not change original array 

15. toString() method
- used to convert an array to a string
- does not take any argument 
- it returns a string
- does not change array

16. toJoin() method 
- used to convert an array to a string
- does not take any argument if you want a comma(default) however it does allow you to give a new seperator as a string argument
- it returns a string
- does not change array

ARRAY DESTRUCTURING
-DESTRUCTURING allows us to extract values from arrays, objects or other iterable data
structures and assign them to variables in a more concise way

iterable data =
