12-03-2023 JS Modules

Js Modules are used to increase code reusability within a framework.project as it allows creating reusable 
components in a file and export it to be used by other files.
Other files can import these reusable components and use.

There are 2 ways to achieve this reusability.
1. CommonJS (BEFORE ES6)
    module.exports is used to export components (properties, functions, classes)
    require is used to import reusable components in another file 

2. ES6 Modules 
    export 
    import 

fileA.js
    // properties - information
    const username = 'johndoeX';
    const password = 'test1234';
    const appURL = 'www.amazon.com';


    // functions 
    const login = (username, password) => {
        // Login code
    }




fileB.js

 Test 1:
 Go to amazon.com
 Login with username and password 
 Validate you can purchase product   


fileC.js
Test 2:
 Go to amazon.com
 Login with username and password 
 Validate you can see all the previous orders


fileD.js
Test 3:
 Go to amazon.com
 Login with username and password 
 Validate you can change your password


fileE.js
Test 4:
 Go to amazon.com
 Login with username and password 
 Validate you can update your address



HOW TO EXPORT properties and functions with CommonJS?
WAY 1 - individual exports 
module.exports.password = password;
module.exports.username = username;
module.exports.appURL = appURL;
module.exports.login = login;


WAY 2 - exporting as an object
const loginInfo = {
    username,
    password,
    appURL,
    login
};

module.exports.loginInfo = loginInfo;


WAY 2 - Improved
module.exports.loginInfo = {
    username,
    password,
    appURL,
    login
};


HOW TO IMPORT properties and functions with CommonJS?
WAY 1 - individual imports 
const {password, username, appURL, login} = require('./fileA');

console.log(username);
console.log(password);
login();

WAY 2 - importing as an object
const loginInfo = require('./fileA');

console.log(loginInfo.username);
console.log(loginInfo.password);
console.log(loginInfo.appURL);
loginInfo.login();


ES6 Modules
- It is added a little bit of syntatic sugar on previous common JS Modules
-Looks more user friendly 
-ES6 is uspported by new versions of Node and all modern browsers

    export is used to export reusable components from a file
    import...from ise used to import reusable components

fileDriver.js
// properties 
const driverName = 'chrome'

// functions 
function quitDriver () {
    // quitting driver
}

functions getDriver() {
    // getting driver 
}

You can export a class as well.

What is default export?
-Default export is a feature used in ES6 Modules and 
allows programmer to make one components as default
-This component can eaily be accessed in other files.
NOTE: There can only be ONE default in a file.
