10 - 15 yeard ago 
10 Manual Testers = 40 - 50 k -> 400 - 500k

20 - 1 hour
200-300 -> 10 - 15 hours -> 2 days for one manula tester 

Selenium - Playright - WebDriverIO - TestCase - ...


2 automation testers - 1 Manual
2000 -> 1800 automation
200 manual 
160k + 50k -> 210 k

Automation is FASTER AND COST EFFECTIVE!!!!

60 - 70K - Manual tester -> 40 - 100 k
100 - 110 - Automation tester -> 80 - 200 k
