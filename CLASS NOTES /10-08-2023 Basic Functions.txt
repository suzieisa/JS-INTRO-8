-These are components that could execute a task whenever used.
-They are reusable and could be used whenever needed. 

Programmin languages provides us thousands of pre-built methods/ Functions

however, you may need more functions and you can create your custom functions
in case the language does not provide it 

// Start the meeting
// create a file
// start coding

every function must start with  NAME
SYNTAX:
function name() {
    // reusable coding statements
