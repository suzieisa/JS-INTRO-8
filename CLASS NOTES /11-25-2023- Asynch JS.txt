Aynchronous JavaScript

-Happening at the same time
-Without order
-not synced

HEAP vs STACK(Call Stack)
-Call Stack stores all the primitive variables with their values
-Call Stack stores references of objects
-Heap stores all the reference objects
-Functions are stored in the stack and will be executed 

NOTE: Stack and Heap are created when a program starts and will be destoryed after
each execution completes and will be ready for the next program

-JS is single threaded and will execite code in a file line by line
-It is not possible to run multiple program at the same time

EVENT LOOP
-The event loop allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations despite the fact that JavaScript is single-threaded. 
-It is done by assigning operations to the operating system whenever and wherever possible. 
-Most operating systems are multi-threaded and hence can handle multiple operations executing in the background. 
-When one of these operations is completed, and the respective callback assigned to that operation is added to the event queue which will eventually be executed.

Features of Event Loop:
-An event loop is an endless loop, which waits for tasks, executes them, and then sleeps until it receives more tasks.
-The event loop executes tasks from the event queue only when the call stack is empty i.e. there is no ongoing task.
-The event loop allows us to use callbacks and promises.
-The event loop executes the tasks starting from the oldest first.


setTimeOut() -> we can use these functions to slow down our programs
It takes 2 arguments;
    1. call back
    2. time as milliseconds
    5000 milliseconds is 5 -> seconds

JavaScript is Aynchronous by its nature and that could cause
logical issues for the events on a web browser or on an application (unexpected order to delays)\
However JS allows us to dy synchronize the events we would like to execute in order (ordered explicitly)
    1. callbacks(BEFORE ES6)
    2. promises (AFTER ES6)
    3. async - await keywords (AFTER ES6)


setTimeOut takes a call back function and telling it how much to wait out
