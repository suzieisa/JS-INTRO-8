These languages help enable us to communicate with computer 
These all help to build anything on computer to help build softwares (MAC IOS ETC
 source code = console.log("HELLO WORLD"); JAVA SCRIPT

 Natural languages are english ETC uses grammar
 binary language uses grammer known as syntax 

 syntax: grammar rules in binary language or porgramming language

 console log basically means "log this info in my console"

 Syntax rules are written rules and MUST be followed
 Coding conventions are standards or common rules that every programmer follows
 even though they are not part of syntax rules
 Java script allows both single or double quotes
 if you start with one always use one not different 

 EXECUTE MEANS RUN IN OTHER WORDS RUN YOUR CODE mean same thing

 every line of code is known as a STATEMENT

    you will see these errors right away without running the code
    these are completely human mistakes like spelling etc
