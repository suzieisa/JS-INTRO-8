10-14-2023 Conditional Statements

-if statement is used to test the condition. 
-It controls the flow of the program based on the condition and executes the statement if condition is truthy (true).
-if statement always takes a condition.
-true, or truthy or any expression that evaluates to true will be considered as true

Syntax:

if(condition) {
    // code block
}


Falsy values: false, null, undefined, NaN, 0, empty string
Truthy values: true, not falsy values

NOTE: If statement can be used without the else statement 
BUT, else cannot be used without if

{} => block

const isClass;


if(isClass) {
    // Execute this block of code
}
else {
    // Execute this block of code
}


if there is class, I will join the class 
else I will go for a walk


if(condition) { // true
    // if block
}
else { // false
    // else block
}

When to use if-else statements? -> if you have only 2 options could possibly be your result
PASS or FAIL 
RETIRED or NOT 
EVEN or ODD 



if-else if â€“ else ladder statement
-If you have more than 2 options could possibly be your result, then you will use if-else if -else ladder statements

A random number could be negative, positive or neutral
0 is neutral

let number = 0;

if(number > 0) {
    // positive
}
else if(number < 0) {
    // negative
}
else { // all the conditions above are false
    // neutral
}

In the above statements, else will be executed if the first 2 conditions are false.
