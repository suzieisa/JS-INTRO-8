Loops: are used to execute a block of code repeatedly or certain amount of times until a termination point
is reached
It prevents code duplication and save time and efforts for programers

5 types of loops 
1. for loop
    for (start; condition; update) {
        // code block to executre
    }

2. while loop
3. do-while loop
4. for...of loop
5. for...in loop

infinite loop: loop that does not reach its termination point.

for(; ;) {
    // code will run infinite times 
}

iteration: each cycle time that loop executes.

2. while loop

syntax:
while(condition) {
    // code block to be executed
}

for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++ );{
    console.log(i);
}

let i = 1;

while(i <= 5) {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}

unreachable codes: piece of code that wil; never execute and usually it is done by mistake

3. do-while loop 
-This is similar to while loop except it runs the code block first, then checks the condition
-so that is the reason your code block for do-while will execute 

HOW TO DECIDE BETWEEN for vs while vs do- while loops?
        DO I know how many times the program will execute? 
        YES                                         NO
        for                                 while OR do -while
                                        Are we going to execute it at least once?
                                            YES                         NO
                                            do - while                  while
