RECAP:

-LOOPS are common concecpts in any programming language and widely used.
-It eliminates duplicated codes and allows programmer to run a block of code repeatedly
-It saves time and effort for the programmer as well.

1. for loop (i loop) (tradional loop) 
2. while loop (Takes one condition)
3. do while loop
4. for...of loop (mostly used with arrays)
5. for...in loop (mostly used with objects)

for(start; condition; update) {
    // code block 
}
//////////////////////////////////
while(condition) {
    // code block
}
//////////////////////////////////
do {
    // cocde block
} while(condition);

while vs do-while
- ** The only difference bt these is that the do-while executes the code first and then 
checks the condition. On the other hand, while checks the condition first and then executes the block of code

NOTE: Above difference tells us. the do while will always execute the block of code at least 
once even though the condition is right away false

4. for...of loop
-It is syntatic sugar added to your loop
-for...of loop makes it easier for programmer to work with arrays or all other iterable objects


WHEN TO USE for loop over for of loop with arrays?
-If you need to chech each element and manipulate them, then for of loop will be preferred.
-If you need to skip and ignore some parts of the array elements and need indexes than use  for loops

NOTE: zero is not affecting the results when you find sum of multiplication while 1 is not affecting
